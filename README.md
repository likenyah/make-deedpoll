## make-deedpoll

make-deedpoll consists of a LaTeX template file and a shell script that uses
[latexmk] to generate a [Deed Poll], used to change your name in the UK.

__NOTE__: I'm not a lawyer; however, as far as I can recall, you can write a
          legally-valid [Deed Poll] on a napkin, so this _should_ be acceptable.
