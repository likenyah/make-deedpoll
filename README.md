# Deed Poll

## Overview

This repository contains a LaTeX template for creating a
[Deed Poll][url-deed-poll], used to change your name in the UK. While it is not
generally necessary, this document expects to be signed by two witnesses.

It is recommended to create several "original" copies of a deed poll so that
you have backups in case your bank, the DVLA, or the Home Office decide they
would like to keep it. It's also probably a good idea to get a driver's licence
or passport with your new name before attempting to change any information with
banks and other similar entities.
